  summary: >-
    I hold a PhD in Electrical Engineering with a multidisciplinary background spanning
    machine learning, physics, and biological systems. My research focuses on efficient
    and agentic AI, particularly reasoning, memory, and compositional generalization in
    large language models. I have experience with large-scale training (up to 7B
    parameters), post-training, alignment, and reinforcement learning.
