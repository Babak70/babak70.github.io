I got my PhD at the Electrical Engineering department of [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) where he was advised by Christophe Moser and Demetri Psaltis working at the intersection of Machine learning and Optics for applications in inverse problems, information retrieval and control systems. My goal was to build robust and reliable machine learning algorithms for controlling real-world complex systems in various disciplines ranging from communication, imaging systems to neuroscience. Currently I am a Postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge where I am doing research on the applications of Machine Learning for the next generation cloud compute including storage and optmization.
